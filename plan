Training Plan:

  Repeat for 1000 different Q-Tables:
    1) Train new Q-Table:
      For a maximum of 100 episodes:
        1) Train until convergence, stop running at convergence
          
        2) Add to [nameofmodel]-train.csv:
            - Number of episodes taken to reach convergence
            - Seconds taken to reach convergence
            - Success rate during training

    2) Test converged Q-Table:
      For 10000 episodes:
        1) Test on same map, dont update values

        2) Add to [nameofmodel]-test.csv:
            - Success rate during testing
            - Average steps per episode
